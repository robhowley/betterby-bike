Cedar Rapids, IA implemented a road diet on four different roads that reduced the number of lanes of traffic. Using
pre/post data, researchers found that there was _no difference in emergency response times_. Over half the EMS
respondents in the follow up survey said the changes had either no impact or a positive impact on response times.

Converting two-way four lane roads to two travel lanes with center left turn lane not only reduces crashes 19-47%, but
can also _improve emergency response times_. Case studies from Ocean City, NJ and Woodbury, NJ demonstrate this; the
former's road diet also included a buffered bike lane in the design.

The post road diet designs make driver behavior more predictable, safer, and with much less speeding. All road users are
better accounted for. These combine to make a more easily navigable street for first responders.

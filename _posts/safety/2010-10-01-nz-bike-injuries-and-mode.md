From 1989 to 2006 New Zealand's _bicycle mode share reduced from 4% to only 1%_. This coincides with a large increase in
transportation by motor vehicle. During that time the _injury rates for cyclists increased 20%_ while declined by 40-50%
for all other modes of transportation.

The injury rates per million hours spent traveling by mode of transportation ...

| Mode              | 1988-91 | 2003-07 | % change |
|:------------------|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|
| Cyclists          |  25.61  |  30.74  |  +20.0%  |
| Car/van driver    |  4.24   |  2.10   |  -50.5%  |
| Car/van passenger |  5.64   |  2.89   |  -48.8%  |
| Motorcyclist      | 185.14  | 107.64  |  -41.9%  |
| Pedestrian        |  4.29   |  2.38   |  -44.5%  |

It is suspected that the "safety in numbers" effect went away as mode share switched from bikes to cars. It is noted
that the NZ passed an all age mandatory helmet law in 1994.

In September 2010 NYC studied the difference between unpainted bike lanes and those painted green. The following results
were released in February 2011.

* cars drive in the bike lane
  * 16% of the time when it's unpainted
  * 7% of the time when it's painted green 
* bike lanes are obstructed
  * 7% of the time when unpainted
  * 4% of the time when painted green

Based upon these results, along with those from over a dozen other cities, MUTCD adopted green paint as an approved
design for bike lanes to enhance safety.

#### Bike lanes painted green are safer than unpainted bike lanes

In September 2010 NYC studied the difference between unpainted bike lanes and those painted green. The following results
were released in February 2011.

* cars drive in the bike lane
  * 16% of the time when it's unpainted
  * 7% of the time when it's painted green 
* bike lanes are obstructed
  * 7% of the time when unpainted
  * 4% of the time when painted green

Based upon these results, along with those from over a dozen other cities, MUTCD adopted green paint as an approved
design for bike lanes to enhance safety.

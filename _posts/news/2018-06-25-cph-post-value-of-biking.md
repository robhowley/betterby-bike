Danish government estimates that 1 km of biking in Copenhagen creates 4.80 kroner (~ $1 per mile) in economic value. If
that trip by bike replaced a car trip the economic value goes up to 10.09 kroner per km (~ $2.10 per mile). In 2017,
43% of work commutes in the city were taken by bike, so this value estimate is across _a lot_ of kilometers of biking.

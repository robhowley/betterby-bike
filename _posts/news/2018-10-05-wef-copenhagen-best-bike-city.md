As Copenhagen's protected bike network grows, cyclists feel safer, and ridership grows. Government estimates are that
each new protected route yields 15-20% more riders. From 2006 to 2016 there's been a 22% increase in kilometres covered
by bike (1.4 _million_ km in 2016). Around 62% of commutes for those that live and work in Copenhagen are by bike.

Key quote ...

> One of the main reasons for the popularity of cycling in Denmark is the network of paths, including innovative
> bridges, which form cycling superhighways across the city. This is perhaps the key to understanding why Copenhagen is
> also one of the safest places to be a cyclist.

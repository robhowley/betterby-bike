Salt Lake City removed 30% of parking on Broadway and that stretch saw retail sales outperform the rest of the city by
~25%. The road diet converted angled parking to parallel parking to create the space for 9 blocks of protected bike
lanes.

When all was said and done, the business owners loved it and attribute their business growth to the street redesign.

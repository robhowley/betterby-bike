Studied business corridors that received street redesigns in 6 different cities. Business results were often positive,
but in a few cases had no impact. Overall, food service and retail sales improve as does employment in those sectors.
These results hold in cases where parking was removed for bike lanes.

where ✅ indicates improvement in associated business metrics including sales, employment, wage growth, or a subset of
the three. A ⛔️ indicates a statistically significant negative impact. A blank cell
means no change detected. The only instance of a negative impact was a mixed result on Memphis' Madison Ave where
_retail sales grew_ but retail employment declined. So, of 13 bike friendly redesigns across 6 metro areas we have 15
positive impacts and one negative.

_On net, the evidence is clear that adding bike infrastructure is good for business._

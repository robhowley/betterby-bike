Fact: ~27% of car trips are under 3 miles ...

... and in 2017, ~60% were less than 6 miles.

From the data in the FHWA funded [National Household Travel Survey](https://nhts.ornl.gov/) we see how infrequent long
car trips really are.

| Trip distance       | % of trips |
|:--------------------|:----------:|
| Less than 0.5 miles |    3.8%    |
| 1 mile              |   12.6%    |
| 2 miles             |   11.3%    |
| 3 miles             |   10.7%    |
| 4 miles             |    7.5%    |
| 5 miles             |    5.8%    |
| 6 - 10 miles        |   19.7%    |
| 11 - 15 miles       |    9.8%    |
| 16 - 20 miles       |    6.0%    |
| 21 - 30 miles       |    6.0%    |
| 31+ miles           |    6.9%    |

Many car trips are short local drives that are well within biking distance especially when the growing popularity of
e-bikes is factored in.
